# Description

This repo contains two .NET console applications, a Requester application that sends 
request messages and a Responder application that replies response messages back
to the Requester.

The Requester logs the roundtrip delay to the console.

Run the Responder.exe and the Requester.exe in two separate Command Prompt windows.
